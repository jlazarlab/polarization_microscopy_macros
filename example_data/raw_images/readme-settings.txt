When processing the provided multiple-polarization image (dlmeGFP-c12-2P-multipol.tif), in order to obtain 
files similar to those in in the 'processed_images' directory, these values need to be entered into 
the dialog of the macro for processing images acquired with multiple polarizations ('m' macro):

Starting polarization angle: 90
Polarization angle increment: 15
Linear dichroism visualization: None
...
Azimuth visualization: Yes
Show azimuths for F > 25% of Fmax
Pixel binning: 5 pixels
Azimuth display color: direction
Azimuth size scaling factor: 1.00

Perform quantitative analysis: 2PPM
Analyze a membrane
Unchecked Attempt automated vesicle recognition
Membrane/filament selection width: 0.500 um
Checked Show additional plots
Checked Save result files
